== Peter Palaga

* "Java guy"
* Senior Sustaining Engineer at Red Hat Middleware
** JBoss Fuse/WildFly Camel
** Earlier JBoss EAP/WildFly


== Agenda

* A Spring Boot app
* Bring it to the cloud
* Bonus: Deployment{nbsp}strategies


== A Spring Boot app

https://github.com/ppalaga/horse-ride-service

* Model with a few Entities
* CRUD endpoints provided by Spring Data
* Usual `@SpringBootTest`


== Minishift/Minikube

* Single node Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster
* In a VM (hypervisor required)
* Download and unzip from https://github.com/minishift/minishift/releases
* Add `minishift` binary to `PATH`


=== First steps with Minishift

[source,shell,subs="quotes"]
----
*# You may need more or less CPU and memory*
*# depending on what you do*
minishift start --memory=8GB --cpus=4 --disk-size=50GB

oc login -u developer -p whatever

*# Open the OpenShift web console in browser*
minishift console
----


== Jenkins Pipeline on OpenShift

[source,shell,subs="quotes"]
----
*# make sure you are in the default project*
*$* oc project
myproject
*$* oc new-app https://github.com/ppalaga/horse-ride-service.git
----

* If the git repo contains a Jenkinsfile
** Os creates a `BuildConfig` with a special `Pipeline` strategy
** Provisions a Jenkins instance
** Triggers the first build


== Preparations for a real pipeline

* Git repo inside the cluster
* Separate projects for CI, stage and production
* Some permissions for Jenkins
* Done by `provision.sh` script:

[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/ppalaga/horse-ride-service.git
cd horse-ride-service
git reset --hard provision.sh
oc login -u developer -p whatever
cd src/main/openshift; ./provision.sh
----


== Pipeline

=== Build and test

Provision a database so that the `@SpringBootTest` can pass

[source,shell,subs="quotes"]
----
cd horse-ride-service; git checkout master
git reset --hard testdb
git diff HEAD^ HEAD *# study what changed*
*# Alias the cluster's internal git repo*
URL=http://team:team@gogs-horse-ride-cicd.$(minishift ip).nip.io
git remote add minishift ${URL}/team/horse-ride-service.git
*# Push to the cluster's internal git repo*
git push -f minishift master
*# Go to horse-ride-cicd project in OpenShift console*
*# and check that the pipeline started under Builds > Pipelines*
----


=== Build and test Docker image

[source,shell,subs="quotes"]
----
git reset --hard test-image
git diff HEAD^ HEAD *# study what changed*
git push -f minishift master
*# Look at horse-ride-cicd > Builds > Pipelines*
*# Open the Jenkins log*
----


=== Stage -> approval -> production

[source,shell,subs="quotes"]
----
git reset --hard stage-prod
git diff HEAD^ HEAD *# study what changed*
git push -f minishift master
*# Look at horse-ride-cicd > Builds > Pipelines*
*# Visit the stage and prod sites via links in Jenkins log*
*# Approve the promotion from stage to production*
----


== Blue/green deployments

image::blue-green.svg[]

* Release in a predictable manner
* Reduce downtime
** Easy to switch to roll out a new version
** Easy to roll back if the new version does not behave properly

=== Blue/green demo (1/2)

[source,shell,subs="quotes"]
----
git reset --hard blue-green
git diff HEAD^ HEAD *# study what changed*
git push -f minishift master
*# Look at horse-ride-cicd > Builds > Pipelines*
*# The UI of new deployment should be blue*
----


=== Blue/green demo (2/2)

[source,shell,subs="quotes"]
----
git reset --hard blue-green-green-bg
git diff HEAD^ HEAD *# study what changed*
git push -f minishift master
*# Look at horse-ride-cicd > Builds > Pipelines*
*# The UI of new deployment should be green
----


=== Blue/green Caveats

* Long running sessions/connections need to be handled gracefully.

* Database schema conversions
** Ideally back/forwards compatible - see Edson Yanagas's book
** Downtime may be needed in some cases


== Canary releases

image::canary.svg[]

* Roll out gradually
* Observe canary's health
* Rollback if the canary dies

https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html


=== Canary demo (1/2)

[source,shell,subs="quotes"]
----
git reset --hard canary
git diff HEAD^ HEAD *# study what changed*
git push -f minishift master
*# Observe the iterative checking of canary's health in Jenkins log*
*# This canary survives and its UI background is yellow*
----


=== Canary demo (2/2)

[source,shell,subs="quotes"]
----
git reset --hard canary-dead
git diff HEAD^ HEAD *# study what changed*
git push -f minishift master
*# Observe the iterative checking of canary's health in Jenkins log*
*# This canary dies and its gray UI won't be served after*
*# the rollback*
----



== Wrap up

[%step]
* `https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/[minikube]`/`https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift/getting-started/installing.html[minishift]` to start experimenting
* Jenkins Pipeline a first class citizen on OpenShift
* `https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/[Jenkinsfile]` powerful enough to script your deployment strategy
