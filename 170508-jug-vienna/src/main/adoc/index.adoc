* EAP stands for Enterprise Application Platform
* It is the Java EE Application Server with commercial suppord from Red Hat
* Based on the community project called WildFly
* ... and there is my twitter handle at the bottom

* This is a shorter version of this talk
* CI/CD parts stripped out
* Next slide: To warm up, please raise your hand...

== What are source dependencies?

=== The "usual" dependencies

* Software projects often depend on *artifacts* produced by other projects
* Those artifacts
** typically contain compiled code
** usually available in repositories (Maven Central, jcenter, ...) on the internet
* Build tools (Maven, Gradle, ...) responsible for finding and downloading the dependencies


=== Source dependencies

* The build of every git commit deterministic enough
+
=> Source code of a dependency enough to use it in a dependent project
+
* The build tool has to:
** Check out the sources (e.g. from a git repo)
** Build the artifacts required by the dependent project

NB: Dependency artifacts do not need to be available in a repository


== The idea is not new

Some languages (or their build tools) have it already


=== Ruby

`Gemfile` of a Ruby project

[source,ruby]
----
# A binary dependency pulled from rubygems.org
gem 'rack', '2.0.1'

# A source dependency built by Blunder
# from a git commit
gem 'rack',
    :git => 'https://github.com/rack/rack.git',
    :ref => '0bd839d'
----


=== Scala

`build.sbt`

[source,java]
----
// A binary dependency
libraryDependencies +=
    "com.typesafe.play" %% "play-slick" % "2.0.2"

// A source dependency
myProject
  .dependsOn(
    ProjectRef(
      uri("git://github.com/freekh/play-slick.git#v1.2.3")
      "play-slick"
    )
  )
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Anybody knows any other language/build tool allowing this?
--

== What is this good for?

=== Testing and Integration

* Test each commit of the dependency inside the dependent project
* Find issues early


=== Multilayer Continuous Delivery

Multiple components in multiple *separate source repositories*

image::wf-component-dependencies.svg[]


[NOTE.speaker]
--
* The components depend on each other, building a dependency hierarchy
* Independent release cycles
--


=== Fixing third-party code (1/2)

Dependency project dead or not releasing fast enough

* Fork and use as a source dependency
* No consent from the dependency project needed

=== Fixing third-party code (2/2)

Dependency project doing nasty things

* Fork and accept only some of their changes (e.g. security fixes)
* Throw away all that can harm your stability
* Again, no consent from the dependency project needed


== How is this different from Maven SNAPSHOTs?

=== SNAPSHOTs built locally

* What you build is what you get
* Handy on a developer's machine
* Hard to share:
** CI machines
** Teammates


=== Remote SNAPSHOTs are evil

[%step]
* You never know what you get
** local/remote SNAPSHOT?
** latest today != latest tomorrow
+
{nbsp}
+
* The build of a component depending on another SNAPSHOT component is *not reproducible* over time
* Remote SNAPSHOTs should be always off


=== Source dependencies

[%step]
* As compared SNAPSHOTs:
** Reproducible
** Easy to share with teammates and CI
+
{nbsp}
+
* As compared to traditional releases:
** Releases done just for the sake of testing and integration may be avoided
** May eliminate the need for releases and the artifact repository infra altogether


== `srcdeps`

The source dependencies for Maven and Gradle


=== How `srcdeps` work (1/3)

Three basic ideas

[%step]
1. Coin a convention for version strings to express the commit ID to build the given dependency from
+
[source,xml,subs=+quotes]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.my-group</groupId>
  <artifactId>my-artifact</artifactId>
  <version>1.2.3-SRC-revision-*deadbeef*</version>
</dependency><!--             ⬑ a git commit ID  -->
----
+
2. Provide a configuration that maps dependency artifacts to source repository URLs


=== How `srcdeps` work (2/3)

[start=3]
3. Mechanism to trigger the build of the dependency:
** Maven: custom implementation of the Local Maven Repository
** Gradle PoC: srcdeps plugin scans the dependencies in `project.afterEvaluate {}`


=== How `srcdeps` work (3/3)

[.text-left]
When an artifact with `*-SRC-revision-{commitId}` version is found

[%step]
* Find a git URL for it
* Checkout the source to `~/.m2/srcdeps` directory
* Change the versions in the `pom.xml`/`build.gradle` files to whatever `*-SRC-revision-{commitId}` was requested
* Build and install locally


== Demo: `srcdeps` with Maven


link:#_miscellaneous_code_srcdeps_code_features[Skip things shown in demo]


=== Let's have a simple project

[source,java]
----
public class Demo {
  public String sayHello() {
    return "Hello World!";
  }
}

public class DemoTest {
  @Test
  public void sayHelloTest() {
    Assert.assertEquals("Hello World!", new Demo().sayHello());
  }
}
----

=== We need a new assertion

[source,java,subs=+normal]
----
public class Demo {
  public String sayHello() {
    return "Hello World!";
  }
}

public class DemoTest {
  @Test
  public void sayHelloTest() {
    Assert.[keyword]*assertJavaViennaHello*(new Demo().sayHello());
    //      ⬑ not available in the stock jUnit :(
  }
}
----


=== Clone JUnit

[source,java]
----
public class Assert {

  // Add the new method to org.junit.Assert
  public static void assertJavaViennaHello(String actual) {
    assertEquals(
      "Not the right conference!!!",
      "Hello Java Vienna!", actual
    );
  }
...
----

\... and commit and push to your fork


=== Intialize `srcdeps` configuration in the depeendent project

[source,shell]
----
mvn org.srcdeps.mvn:srcdeps-maven-plugin:3.0.1:init
----

That generates `.mvn/extensions.xml` and `.mvn/srcdeps.yaml` files for you


=== `.mvn/extensions.xml`

[source,xml]
----
<extensions>
  <extension>
    <groupId>org.l2x6.srcdeps</groupId>
    <artifactId>srcdeps-maven-local-repository</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.1</version>
  </extension>
</extensions>
----

* Maven Core Extensions since Maven 3.3.1
* Allows for replacing substantial parts of Maven by our own custom implementations
* Much more powerful than the plugin API
** Parent, BoM imports are looked up earlier than any plugin code can be invoked


=== `srcdeps.yaml`

[source,yaml]
----
configModelVersion: 2.0
repositories:
  junit:
    selectors:
    - junit # a groupId[:artifactId[:version]] pattern
            # may contain * wildcards
    urls:
    - git:https://github.com/ppalaga/junit4.git
----

* A mapping from artifacts to git URLs
* Plus some other options


=== Upgrade `junit` in the dependent project

[source,xml,subs=+quotes]
----
...
<dependency>
  <groupId>junit</groupId>
  <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
  <scope>test</scope>
  <version>4.13-SRC-revision-*fd0a1c029b99277c955417b0c*</version>
</dependency>
...
----


== Build the dependent project

[source,shell]
----
cd srcdeps-demo
mvn clean test
...
Failed tests:
  sayHelloTest(org.srcdeps.DemoTest): Not the right conference!
    expected:<Hello [Java Vienna]!> but was:<Hello [World]!>
...
----

Fix `Demo.sayHello()` to return `"Hello Java Vienna!"`

[source,shell]
----
cd srcdeps-demo
mvn clean test
...
Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
...
BUILD SUCCESS
----

Q.E.D.


=== Interesting locations

* The source dependency was built under `${local.maven.repo.dir}/../srcdeps/${groupId}`, typically `~/.m2/srcdeps/${groupId}`
* The source dependency was installed in the local Maven repo, typically `~/.m2/repository


== Gradle support

* Proof of Concept stage




== `srcdeps` features

* Dependencies can refer to not only commits, but also branches and tags:
** `1.2.3-SRC-revision-{myCommitId}`
** `1.2.3-SRC-branch-{myBranchName}`
** `1.2.3-SRC-revision-{myTagName}`
+
{nbsp}
+
* Source dependencies work for vitually any kind of a dependency incl. parent, managed imports and even plugins

== `srcdeps.yaml` config. options

* `verbosity` of dependency builds
* Custom arguments for dependency builds, e.g. `-Dcheckstyle.skip`
* `-DskipTests` by default
* `buildTimeout`
* By default `failWith: {goals: release:prepare}` to prevent releases with source dependencies
* See https://github.com/srcdeps/srcdeps-core/blob/master/doc/srcdeps.yaml

== Limitations

Can you think of any?

[options="step"]
* Tools unaware of `srcdeps` (IDEs, static pom.xml analysers, ...) will see the `-SRC-` deps as non-available
* Only Maven and git supported well ATM, Gradle on the way
* However immutable git commits are, they can still disappear from repos, or even the whole repo can be deleted
** Best practice: use `srcdeps` only against your own repos or your own mirrors of third party repos
* There is still a few things that may differ among devs: java version, mvn version
** Projects should use `mvnw` with a fixed mvn version
** Enforcer plugin for Java version
* The `-SRC-` artifacts (jars, wars, ...) built by you and me will typically not be binary equal
** Typically will make no harm
** Where would this matter actually?


== History of `srcdeps`

* Created around October 2015 during my time in Hawkular link:https://github.com/hawkular/[]
** A greenfield project with several components
** To speedup the integration of components
** Positive feedback, still in use

* Pull request to introduce `srcdeps` to WildFly Core open this week
** Discussion in progress on wildfly-dev@lists.jboss.org
** Looks like `srcdeps` will be allowed in pull requests but will not be allowed to be merged to stable
   branches, such as master
   -> a partial productivity win for the submitter

== Things to remember about `srcdeps`

* Eliminates the idle time when waiting to a release of a dependency
* Shortens the integration/delivery cycles in complex dependency hierarchies
* May eliminate the need for a shared Maven repository
* Gives power to the consuming project because no action or consent from the dependency project required
