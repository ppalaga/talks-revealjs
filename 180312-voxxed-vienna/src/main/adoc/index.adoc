== Agenda

* A Spring Boot app
* Bring it to the cloud
* Deployment strategies


== A Spring Boot app

https://github.com/ppalaga/horse-ride-service

* Model with a few Entities
* CRUD endpoints provided by Spring Data
* Usual `@SpringBootTest`


[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Horse rides scheduling - Diesel engines forbidden soon, think of Uber for horses, Austrian ministry of Internal Affairs,
* Usual Maven setup
* Model with a couple of Entities
* CRUD endpoints provided by Spring Data
* One hand crafted endpoint for ride scheduling
* Usual @SpringBootTest
* So far developed only locally against a manually provisioned PostgreSQL database
* A static index.html page we'll use to demo some things
* Nothing fancy here, it's all just stock Spring Boot code

PP:
* The customer wants us not only to build the app, but also to run it
* The choice of platform and tools is up to us
* We want a process not only to build and test our app but also to deploy it in a controlled and predictable way
* We want to be able to do all those fancy things like Blue-green Deployments, Canary Releases and A/B Testing

MJ:
* Containers? Yes, because we like how the solve packaging incl. OS, configuration and provisioning
* Kubernetes standard these days, lets have a look at it
* Plain Kubernetes?
* Why OpenShift?
** ...

== Minishift/Minikube

* Single node Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster
* In a VM (hypervisor required)
* Download and unzip from https://github.com/minishift/minishift/releases
* Add `minishift` binary to `PATH`


=== First steps with Minishift

[source,shell,subs="quotes"]
----
*# You may need more or less CPU and memory*
*# depending on what you do*
minishift start --memory=8GB --cpus=4 --disk-size=50GB

oc login -u developer -p whatever

*# Open the OpenShift web console in browser*
minishift console
----

[NOTE.speaker]

PP:
* The jungle of Kube objects looks pretty scary
* I'd expect to have to handcraft huge templates to construct the pipeline somehow...

MJ:
* Not necessarily, depends on how much you want your pipeline to get polished
* Do you like Jenkins?
PP: Of course
MJ: Jenkins pipeline
PP: Groovy based DSL? - of course!
MJ: So just add a basic Jenkinsfile to your project and let's see what happens
PP: I happen to have a Jenkinsfile there already
MJ: What's in there?
PP: It is pretty minimal. It just issues the usual Maven build
MJ: It is skipping tests?
PP: Er... yes, because I did not know how to provision a database
PP: BTW, who of you is using Jenkinsfiles?
--


== Jenkins Pipeline on OpenShift

[source,shell,subs="quotes"]
----
*# make sure you are in the default project*
*$* oc project
myproject
*$* oc new-app https://github.com/ppalaga/horse-ride-service.git
----

* If the git repo contains a Jenkinsfile
** Os creates a `BuildConfig` with a special `Pipeline` strategy
** Provisions a Jenkins instance
** Triggers the first build

[NOTE.speaker]
--
PP: What? OpenShift provisions a Jenkins instance for me?
MJ: Yes, that's one of those small diffs against plain Kube I mentioned earlier

oc delete project ride
--


== Preparations for a real pipeline

* Git repo inside the cluster
* Separate projects for CI, stage and production
* Some permissions for Jenkins
* Done by `provision.sh` script:

[source,shell]
----
git clone https://github.com/ppalaga/horse-ride-service.git
cd horse-ride-service
git reset --hard provision.sh
oc login -u developer -p whatever
cd src/main/openshift; ./provision.sh
----


[NOTE.speaker]
--
MJ: private repo practical if you do not want to pay for private GitHub repos
* Also practical for us when on a flaky conf. WiFi
* Also important if your Kube/Os cluster is not accessible from the internet
PP: Yes, Github hooks would not work...

* The last step calls  oc new-app with the internal git url

--


== Pipeline

=== Build and test

Provision a database so that the `@SpringBootTest` can pass

[source,shell,subs="quotes"]
----
cd horse-ride-service; git checkout master
git reset --hard testdb
git diff HEAD^ HEAD *# study what changed*
*# Alias the cluster's internal git repo*
URL=http://team:team@gogs-horse-ride-cicd.$(minishift ip).nip.io
git remote add minishift ${URL}/team/horse-ride-service.git
*# Push to the cluster's internal git repo*
git push -f minishift master
*# Go to horse-ride-cicd project in OpenShift console*
*# and check that the pipeline started under Builds > Pipelines*
----


[NOTE.speaker]
--
PP: in baseline, the tests were skipped
* Here, a database container is provisioned before running the mvn build
* What is this "openshift" object?
MJ: OpenShift Client Jenkins plugin
* It is available in the Os Jenkins image by default
PP: How about auth?
MJ: The client acts as user "jenkins"
PP: What can it do?
MJ: Most of usual things in the current project
* but if you want to do something in a project distict from the project where the Jenkinsfile is defined,
you have to grant some permissions to Jenkins manually
* That's what we have done in provision.sh script
PP: env vars to pass the database info
PP: what if I do not want expose the password in the Jenkinsfile?
MJ: ...
--

=== Build and test Docker image

[source,shell,subs="quotes"]
----
git reset --hard test-image
git diff HEAD^ HEAD *# study what changed*
git push -f minishift master
*# Look at horse-ride-cicd > Builds > Pipelines*
*# Open the Jenkins log*
----


[NOTE.speaker]
--
Jenkinsfile:

* A new stage
PP: What is fabric8:build
MJ: A mvn plugin for building Docker images
PP: so I do not have to issue play with the docker command?
MJ: no, and it would be rather complicated inside the cluster
PP: Why?
MJ: Because the cluster does not expose the docker daemon to everyone
PP: Hm... how are non-maven projects built then?
MJ: s2i ... and actually, the fabric8 plugin runs an s2i build under the hood
PP: interesting
PP: How do I tell the plugin what I want it to do?
MJ: look into pom.xml
PP: What is <name>%g/%a:test</name> ?
MJ: name and tag to push to cluster-internal docker repo
PP: So there is a docker repo in the cluster?
* That's nice that I do not have to set it up myself
PP: <assembly> ?
MJ: That specifies what gets into the image. Just open the assembly.xml
PP: I like that this is using technologies I actaully know already
MJ: back to Jenkinsfile
* Create a new app, but this time not out of a git repo, but out of the image tag we have just pushed using fabric8 plugin
PP: I see

PP: probe?
MJ: ...
PP: OK, it invokes the the /health endpoint provided by Spring Actuator
--

=== Stage -> approval -> production

[source,shell,subs="quotes"]
----
git reset --hard stage-prod
git diff HEAD^ HEAD *# study what changed*
git push -f minishift master
*# Look at horse-ride-cicd > Builds > Pipelines*
*# Visit the stage and prod sites via links in Jenkins log*
*# Approve the promotion from stage to production*
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Two new stages
* Provision a database
* Tag
* Wait for rollout
* Check the link, Approve
* The same in prod: tag, rollout, link

PP: That's straightforward: approve -> production
* But let's say I want to have a safe way back
--

== Blue/green deployments

image::blue-green.svg[]

* Release in a predictable manner
* Reduce downtime
** Easy to switch to roll out a new version
** Easy to roll back if the new version does not behave properly

https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* In Kube/Os:
** One route, two services (and deployments)
** The route switches based on spec.to.name: blue|green
--


=== Blue/green demo (1/2)

[source,shell,subs="quotes"]
----
git reset --hard blue-green
git diff HEAD^ HEAD *# study what changed*
git push -f minishift master
*# Look at horse-ride-cicd > Builds > Pipelines*
*# The UI of new deployment should be blue*
----


=== Blue/green demo (2/2)

[source,shell,subs="quotes"]
----
git reset --hard blue-green-green-bg
git diff HEAD^ HEAD *# study what changed*
git push -f minishift master
*# Look at horse-ride-cicd > Builds > Pipelines*
*# The UI of new deployment should be green
----


=== Blue/green Caveats

* Long running sessions/connections need to be handled gracefully.
* Database schema conversions
** Ideally back/forwards compatible - see Edson's book http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/migrating-to-microservice-databases.csp
** Downtime may be needed in some cases


== Canary releases

image::canary.svg[]

* Roll out gradually
* Observe canary's health
* Rollback if the canary dies

https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Deployment strategy actually selectable for a DeploymentConfig
** "Rolling" strategy is the default
*** provides a minimal canary
*** If readiness never succeeds, the new image is not rolled out
    and the deployment actually fails after a few retries.

Is this enough? - No

** "Recreate" - old code and new code do not run at once, but incurs downtime, supports pre, mid, post hooks to trigger any necessary migration steps
** "Custom" - provide your own image that is run to perform the migration
--

=== Canary demo (1/2)

[source,shell,subs="quotes"]
----
git reset --hard canary
git diff HEAD^ HEAD *# study what changed*
git push -f minishift master
*# Observe the iterative checking of canary's health in Jenkins log*
*# This canary survives and its UI background is yellow*
----


=== Canary demo (2/2)

[source,shell,subs="quotes"]
----
git reset --hard canary-dead
git diff HEAD^ HEAD *# study what changed*
git push -f minishift master
*# Observe the iterative checking of canary's health in Jenkins log*
*# This canary dies and its gray UI won't be served after*
*# the rollback*
----



== Wrap up

[%step]
* `https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/[minikube]`/`https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift/getting-started/installing.html[minishift]` to start experimenting
* Jenkins Pipeline a first class citizen on OpenShift
* `https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/[Jenkinsfile]` powerful enough to script your deployment strategy
