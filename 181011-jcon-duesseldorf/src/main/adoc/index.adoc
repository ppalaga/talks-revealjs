== What are source dependencies?

=== The "usual" dependencies

* Software projects often depend on *artifacts* produced by other projects
* Those artifacts
** typically contain compiled code
** usually available in repositories (Maven Central, jcenter, ...) on the internet
* Build tools (Maven, Gradle, ...) responsible for finding and downloading the dependencies


=== Source dependencies

* Build of a git commit deterministic enough
+
=> Source code of a dependency enough to use it in a dependent project
+
* The build tool has to:
** Check out the sources (e.g. from a git repo)
** Build the artifacts required by the dependent project

NB: Dependency artifacts do not need to be available in an artifact repository


== The idea is not new

Some languages (or their build tools) have it for some time already


=== Ruby

`Gemfile` of a Ruby project

[source,ruby]
----
# A binary dependency pulled from rubygems.org
gem 'rack', '2.0.1'

# A source dependency built by Blunder
# from a git commit
gem 'rack',
    :git => 'https://github.com/rack/rack.git',
    :ref => '0bd839d'
----


=== Scala

`build.sbt`

[source,java]
----
// A binary dependency
libraryDependencies +=
    "com.typesafe.play" %% "play-slick" % "2.0.2"

// A source dependency
myProject
  .dependsOn(
    ProjectRef(
      uri("git://github.com/freekh/play-slick.git#v1.2.3")
      "play-slick"
    )
  )
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Anybody knows any other language/build tool allowing this?
--

== What is this good for?

Generally:

* No release of the dependency in a remote artifact repository such as Maven Central
* Sources of the dependency available


=== Testing and Integration

* Test each commit of the dependency inside the dependent project
* Find issues early
* Speedup the delivery of the dependent project


=== Fixing third-party code (1/2)

Dependency project dead or not releasing fast enough

* Fork and use as a source dependency
* No consent from the dependency project needed


=== Fixing third-party code (2/2)

Dependency project doing nasty things

* Fork and accept only some of their changes (e.g. security fixes)
* Throw away all that can harm your stability
* Again, no consent from the dependency project needed


== Implementations

== `srcdeps`

=== How `srcdeps` works (1/3)

Configuration to map dependency artifacts to source repository URLs and specific revisions

[source,yaml]
----
configModelVersion: 2.3  # srcdeps.yaml file
repositories:
  org.mygroup:    # a repository ID
    includes:
    - org.mygroup # a groupId[:artifactId[:version]] pattern
                  # may contain * wildcards
    urls:
    - git:https://github.com/my-org/my-project.git

    # The git ref to build
    buildRef: revision-abcd1234

    # trigger source build only for versions matching this pattern
    buildVersionPattern: .*-SNAPSHOT
----


=== How `srcdeps` works (2/3)

[.text-left]
Mechanism to trigger the build of the dependency:

* `srcdeps-maven`: custom implementation of the Local Maven Repository
* `srcdeps-gradle-plugin`: `srcdeps` plugin scans the dependencies during `afterEvaluate` phase


=== How `srcdeps` work (3/3)

[.text-left]
For every lookup in the Local Maven Repository:

[%step]
* Find a git URL for it in `srcdeps.yaml`, if found then
* Checkout the source to `~/.m2/srcdeps` directory
* Change the versions in the `pom.xml`/`build.gradle` files to whatever version string was requested
* Build the dependency and install the resulting artifacts locally
* The primary build then takes the artifacts from the Maven Local Repository


== Demo: `srcdeps` with Maven

link:index.html#/_code_srcdeps_code_for_gradle[Skip things shown live]


=== Let's have a simple project

[source,java]
----
public class Demo {
  public String sayHello() {
    return "Hello World!";
  }
}

public class DemoTest {
  @Test
  public void sayHelloTest() {
    Assert.assertEquals("Hello World!", new Demo().sayHello());
  }
}
----

=== We need a new assertion

[source,java,subs=+normal]
----
public class Demo {
  public String sayHello() {
    return "Hello World!";
  }
}

public class DemoTest {
  @Test
  public void sayHelloTest() {
    Assert.[keyword]*assertHelloJcon*(new Demo().sayHello());
    //      ⬑ not available in the stock jUnit :(
  }
}
----


=== Clone JUnit

[source,java]
----
public class Assert {

  // Add the new method to org.junit.Assert
  public static void assertHelloJcon(String actual) {
    assertEquals(
      "Not the right conference!!!",
      "Hello JCON!", actual
    );
  }
...
----

\... and commit and push to your fork


=== Intialize `srcdeps` configuration in the dependent project

[source,shell]
----
mvn org.srcdeps.mvn:srcdeps-maven-plugin:3.3.2:init
----

That generates `.mvn/extensions.xml` and `.mvn/srcdeps.yaml` files for you


=== `.mvn/extensions.xml`

[source,xml]
----
<extensions>
  <extension>
    <groupId>org.srcdeps.mvn</groupId>
    <artifactId>srcdeps-maven-local-repository</artifactId>
    <version>3.3.2</version>
  </extension>
</extensions>
----

* Maven Core Extensions since Maven 3.3.1
* Allows for replacing substantial parts of Maven by our own custom implementations
* Much more powerful than the plugin API
** Parent, BoM imports are looked up earlier than any plugin code can be invoked


=== `srcdeps.yaml`

[source,yaml]
----
configModelVersion: 2.3
repositories:
  junit:
    includes:
    - junit # a groupId[:artifactId[:version]] pattern
            # may contain * wildcards
    urls:
    - git:https://github.com/ppalaga/junit4.git
    buildRef: revision-26d7205c48b7c28b278de403a0473cd9e4bee90b
    buildVersionPattern: .*-srcdeps
----

* Defines which artifacts should be built from which git repos and which particular revisions
* Plus a few other options


=== Upgrade `junit` in the dependent project

[source,xml,subs=+quotes]
----
...
<dependency>
  <groupId>junit</groupId>
  <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
  <scope>test</scope>
  <version>4.13-srcdeps</version><!-- -srcdeps suffix to match -->
                                 <!--  buildVersionPattern     -->
                                 <!--  in srcdeps.yaml         -->
</dependency>
...
----


=== Build the dependent project

[source,shell]
----
cd srcdeps-demo
mvn clean test
...
Failed tests:
  sayHelloTest(org.srcdeps.DemoTest): Not the right conference!
    expected:<Hello [JCON]!> but was:<Hello [World]!>
...
----

Fix `Demo.sayHello()` to return `"Hello JCON!"`

[source,shell]
----
cd srcdeps-demo
mvn clean test
...
Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
...
BUILD SUCCESS
----

Q.E.D.


=== Interesting locations

* The source dependency was built under `${local.maven.repo.dir}/../srcdeps/${groupId}`, typically `~/.m2/srcdeps/${groupId}`
* The source dependency was installed in the local Maven repo, typically `~/.m2/repository


== `srcdeps` features

* Dependencies can refer to not only commits, but also branches and tags:
+
[source,yaml]
----
# srcdeps.yaml file
configModelVersion: 2.3
repositories:
  org.mygroup:
    ...
    # to build from git commit 26d7205c48b7c28b278de403a0473cd9e4bee90b
    buildRef: revision-26d7205c48b7c28b278de403a0473cd9e4bee90b
    # or from git branch called 1.x
    buildRef: branch-1.x
    # or from git tag called v1.2.3
    buildRef: tag-v1.2.3
----
+
{nbsp}
+
* In Maven, source dependencies work for vitually any kind of a dependency incl. parent, managed imports and even plugins

=== `srcdeps.yaml` config. options

[%step]
* `verbosity` of dependency builds
* Custom arguments for dependency builds, e.g. `-Dcheckstyle.skip`
* `-DskipTests` by default
* `buildTimeout`
* By default `failWith: {goals: release:prepare}` to prevent releases with source dependencies
* Complete reference: https://github.com/srcdeps/srcdeps-core/blob/master/doc/srcdeps.yaml


== Gradle 4.10+ source dependencies

image::gradle-source-dependencies.png[]

https://blog.gradle.org/introducing-source-dependencies

=== Gradle source dependencies demo

=== `hello-gradle` project

[source,java]
----
public class Hello  {
    public String greet()  {
        return "Hello from a Gradle dependency!";
    }
}
----


=== A project dependent on `hello-gradle`

Lives in a separate git repository

[source,java]
----
public class HelloTest {
    @Test
    public void greet() {
        Assert.assertEquals("Hello from a Gradle dependency!", new Hello().greet());
    }
}
----


=== Use `hello-gradle` as a source dependency

[source,groovy]
----
// settings.gradle
sourceControl {
    gitRepository("https://github.com/ppalaga/181011-hello-gradle.git") {
        producesModule("org.srcdeps.hello:hello-gradle")
    }
}

// build.gradle
dependencies {
    implementation('org.srcdeps.hello:hello-gradle') {
        version {
            branch = 'master'
        }
    }
}
----

=== Gradle source dependencies features and limitations

[%step]
* Supports building from tags and branches
* Commit IDs unsupported ATM, https://github.com/gradle/gradle-native/issues/883[issue reported]
* Gradle only ATM, although API available to write a plugin for depending on Maven/Ant/... projects too
* No way to customize the dependency build
** If the jar task depends on running a testsuite, there is no way to avoid it
* Gradle composite builds under the hood


=== Gradle composite build (CB)

* Combine multiple interdependent builds
* Speedup thanks to incremental builds


== Limitations and related technologies

=== General limitations of source dependencies

Can you think of any?

[options="step"]
* Tools unaware of source dependencies (IDEs, static pom.xml analysers, ...) will see them as non-available
* Only git supported ATM
* Imperfect interoperability Maven ⇄  Gradle
* Git commits, tags and branches may disappear from repos; whole repos can be deleted
** Use your own forks/mirrors instead of third party repos


=== Limitations: build reproducibility

The jars and wars built at two occasions will not be the same

[options="step"]
* Problem of all Java build tools
* Java and build tool versions
** `mvnw` and `enforcer` to mitigate
* Environment and time dependent inputs
* ZIP spec requires the entries to be timestamped


=== Release to a public Maven repo?

image::release-with-srcdeps.svg[]


=== Release to a public Maven repo?

image::release-with-srcdeps-2.svg[]


=== Go to production with `srcdeps`?

{nbsp}

[big]#Why not?#

{nbsp}

As long as your ZIP, Docker image, etc. contains all binary deps

== Source dependencies vs. Maven SNAPSHOTs?

=== SNAPSHOTs built locally

* What you build is what you get
* Handy on a developer machine
* Hard to share:
** CI machines
** Teammates


=== Remote SNAPSHOTs are evil

[%step]
* You never know what you get
** local/remote SNAPSHOT?
** latest today != latest tomorrow
+
{nbsp}
+
* The build of a component depending on another SNAPSHOT component
** *Not reproducible* over time
** Reverts won't bring the previous working state
+
{nbsp}
+
* Remote SNAPSHOTs should be always off


== Source dependencies vs. `jitpack.io`

`jitpack.io`: a remote maven repo that builds from sources on demand

[source,xml]
----
<repositories>
  <repository>
     <id>jitpack.io</id>
     <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
  </repository>
</repositories>
----


=== `jitpack.io` limitations

* `G:A:V` to source repository maping rigid: `com.github.User:Repo:Version`
* Special DNS entry needed for a custom `groupId` +
{nbsp}{nbsp} ⬑ Controlled by the owner
* Dependent project may not choose to build from a fork


=== `jitpack.io` advantages

* Caching artifacts -> only the first hit delayed by building
* If they cache forever, they can guarantee bitwise reproducibility


== Source dependencies wrap up

[options="step"]
* Allow depending on unreleased artifacts
* Appropriate build tool required
** `srcdeps` for Maven
** Gradle 4.10+
* Additional flexibility
+
{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp} *Dependencies may not dictate your life anymore!*
