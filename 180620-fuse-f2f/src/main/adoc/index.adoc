Source dependencies for Maven and Gradle

{nbsp}

== Agenda

* Source dependencies:
** What is it
** What is it good for
* `https://github.com/srcdeps/srcdeps[srcdeps]` - the implementation for Maven and Gradle
* Demo
* Context

== What are source dependencies?

=== The "usual" dependencies

* Software projects often depend on *artifacts* produced by other projects
* Those artifacts
** typically contain compiled code
** usually available in repositories (Maven Central, jcenter, ...) on the internet
* Build tools (Maven, Gradle, ...) responsible for finding and downloading the dependencies


=== Source dependencies

* Build of a git commit deterministic enough
+
=> Source code of a dependency enough to use it in a dependent project
+
* The build tool has to:
** Check out the sources (e.g. from a git repo)
** Build the artifacts required by the dependent project

NB: Dependency artifacts do not need to be available in a repository


== The idea is not new

Some languages (or their build tools) have it already


=== Ruby

`Gemfile` of a Ruby project

[source,ruby]
----
# A binary dependency pulled from rubygems.org
gem 'rack', '2.0.1'

# A source dependency built by Blunder
# from a git commit
gem 'rack',
    :git => 'https://github.com/rack/rack.git',
    :ref => '0bd839d'
----


=== Scala

`build.sbt`

[source,java]
----
// A binary dependency
libraryDependencies +=
    "com.typesafe.play" %% "play-slick" % "2.0.2"

// A source dependency
myProject
  .dependsOn(
    ProjectRef(
      uri("git://github.com/freekh/play-slick.git#v1.2.3")
      "play-slick"
    )
  )
----


== What is this good for?

Generally:

* No release of the dependency in a remote artifact repository such as Maven Central
* Sources of the dependency available


=== Testing and Integration

* Test each commit of the dependency inside the dependent project
* Find issues early
* Speedup the delivery of the dependent project


=== Fixing third-party code (1/2)

Dependency project dead or not releasing fast enough

* Fork and use as a source dependency
* No consent from the dependency project needed


=== Fixing third-party code (2/2)

Dependency project doing nasty things

* Fork and accept only some of their changes (e.g. security fixes)
* Throw away all that can harm your stability
* Again, no consent from the dependency project needed


== `srcdeps`

[%step]
* `https://github.com/srcdeps/srcdeps-maven[srcdeps-maven]` since 2015/10, now robust and stable
* `https://github.com/srcdeps/srcdeps-core[srcdeps-core]` for common functionality
* `https://github.com/srcdeps/srcdeps-gradle-plugin[srcdeps-gradle-plugin]` released 2017/10
* `ant` and `sbt` contributions welcome :)


== How `srcdeps` work

Three basic ideas


=== 1. Mark artifacts to build (1/2)

Option 1: in `pom.xml`

[source,xml,subs=+quotes]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.my-group</groupId>
  <artifactId>my-artifact</artifactId>
  <version>1.2.3-SRC-revision-*deadbeef*</version>
  <!--                          ⬑ a git commit ID  -->
  <!-- alternatives:
  <version>1.2.3-SRC-branch-master</version>
  <version>1.2.3-SRC-tag-v1.2.3</version> -->
</dependency>
----

=== 1. Mark artifacts to build (2/2)

Option 2: in `srcdeps.yaml`

[source,yaml]
----
configModelVersion: 2.3  # srcdeps.yaml file
repositories:
  org.my-group:
    includes:
    - org.my-group # a groupId[:artifactId[:version]] pattern
                   # may contain * wildcards

    buildVersionPattern: .*-SNAPSHOT   # any version matching this
                                       # will be rebuilt using
    buildRef: branch-master            # master branch

    # buildRef: revision-1234abcd      # for a commit
    # buildRef: tag-v1.2.3             # for a tag
----


=== 2. Define sources to build from

Configuration to map dependency artifacts to source repository URLs

[source,yaml]
----
configModelVersion: 2.3  # srcdeps.yaml file
repositories:
  org.my-group:
    includes:
    - org.my-group

    buildVersionPattern: .*-SNAPSHOT
    buildRef: branch-master

    urls:                                     # build the
    - git:https://github.com/myorg/myproj.git # matching artifacts
                                              # from this git repo
----


=== 3. Trigger the build

* Maven: custom implementation of the Local Maven Repository
* Gradle: `srcdeps` plugin scans the dependencies during `afterEvaluate` phase


=== How `srcdeps` work (4/4)

[.text-left]
When a marked artifact is requested from the Local Maven Repository:

[%step]
* Figure out the revision/branch/tag either from the version string or from `srcdeps.yaml`
* Find an associated git URL in `srcdeps.yaml`
* Checkout the sources to `~/.m2/srcdeps` directory
* Change the versions in the `pom.xml`/`build.gradle` files to whatever version was requested
* Build the dependency and install the resulting artifacts locally
* The primary build then takes the artifacts from the Local Maven Repository


== Demo: `srcdeps` with Maven


link:index.html#/_code_srcdeps_code_for_gradle[Skip things shown live]


=== Let's have a simple project

[source,java]
----
public class Demo {
  public String sayHello() {
    return "Hello World!";
  }
}

public class DemoTest {
  @Test
  public void sayHelloTest() {
    Assert.assertEquals("Hello World!", new Demo().sayHello());
  }
}
----

=== We need a new assertion

[source,java,subs=+normal]
----
public class Demo {
  public String sayHello() {
    return "Hello World!";
  }
}

public class DemoTest {
  @Test
  public void sayHelloTest() {
    Assert.[keyword]*assertHelloFuse*(new Demo().sayHello());
    //      ⬑ not available in the stock jUnit :(
  }
}
----


=== Clone JUnit

[source,java]
----
public class Assert {

  // Add the new method to org.junit.Assert
  public static void assertHelloFuse(String actual) {
    assertEquals(
      "Not the right conference!!!",
      "Hello Fuse!", actual
    );
  }
...
----

\... and commit and push to your fork


=== Intialize `srcdeps` configuration in the dependent project

[source,shell]
----
mvn org.srcdeps.mvn:srcdeps-maven-plugin:3.3.1:init
----

That generates `.mvn/extensions.xml` and `.mvn/srcdeps.yaml` files for you


=== `.mvn/extensions.xml`

[source,xml]
----
<extensions>
  <extension>
    <groupId>org.l2x6.srcdeps</groupId>
    <artifactId>srcdeps-maven-local-repository</artifactId>
    <version>3.3.0</version>
  </extension>
</extensions>
----

* Maven Core Extensions since Maven 3.3.1
* Allows for replacing substantial parts of Maven by our own custom implementations
* Much more powerful than the plugin API
** Parent, BoM imports are looked up earlier than any plugin code can be invoked


=== `srcdeps.yaml`

[source,yaml]
----
configModelVersion: 2.3
repositories:
  junit:
    includes:
    - junit # a groupId[:artifactId[:version]] pattern
            # may contain * wildcards
    urls:
    - git:https://github.com/ppalaga/junit4.git
----

* A mapping from artifacts to git URLs
* Plus a few other options


=== Upgrade `junit` in the dependent project

[source,xml,subs=+quotes]
----
...
<dependency>
  <groupId>junit</groupId>
  <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
  <scope>test</scope>
  <version>4.13-SRC-revision-*fd0a1c029b99277c955417b0c*</version>
</dependency>
...
----


=== Build the dependent project

[source,shell]
----
cd srcdeps-demo
mvn clean test
...
Failed tests:
  sayHelloTest(org.srcdeps.DemoTest): Not the right conference!
    expected:<Hello [Fuse]!> but was:<Hello [World]!>
...
----

Fix `Demo.sayHello()` to return `"Hello Fuse!"`

[source,shell]
----
cd srcdeps-demo
mvn clean test
...
Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
...
BUILD SUCCESS
----

Q.E.D.


=== Interesting locations

* The source dependency was built under `${local.maven.repo.dir}/../srcdeps/${groupId}`, typically `~/.m2/srcdeps/${groupId}`
* The source dependency was installed in the local Maven repo, typically `~/.m2/repository


== Limitations

Can you think of any?

[options="step"]
* Tools unaware of `srcdeps` (IDEs, static pom.xml analysers, ...) will see the `-SRC-` deps as non-available
* Only git supported ATM
* Gradle support new, Ant and sbt wait for contributions
* However immutable git commits are, they can still disappear from repos, or even the whole repo can be deleted
** Use your own forks/mirrors instead of third party repos


=== Limitations: build reproducibility

The jars and wars built at two occasions will not be the same

[options="step"]
* Not a `srcdeps` specific problem
* Java and build tool versions
** `mvnw` and `enforcer` to mitigate
* Env and time dependent inputs
* ZIP spec requires the entries to be timestamped


=== Limitations: build def clash

`srcdeps` lets the dependent project specify the build command

[options="step"]
* Projects A and B depend on C
** A defines build of C as +
   `mvn install -Pprofile1`
** B defines build of C as +
   `mvn install -Dwhatever`
* Only the first command gets executed

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* cmd including goals, profiles, system properties, env vars, ...
--


== Release to a public Maven repo with `srcdeps`?

{nbsp}

[big]#NO!#

{nbsp}

`srcdeps` transparent only to the immediate descendants

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Release to a public Maven repo
*
--


=== Go to production with `srcdeps`?

{nbsp}

[big]#Why not?#

{nbsp}

As long as your ZIP, RPM, Docker deliverable contains all binary deps


== How is this different from Maven SNAPSHOTs?

=== SNAPSHOTs built locally

* What you build is what you get
* Handy on a developer machine
* Hard to share:
** CI machines
** Teammates


=== Remote SNAPSHOTs are evil

[%step]
* You never know what you get
** local/remote SNAPSHOT?
** latest today != latest tomorrow
+
{nbsp}
+
* The build of a component depending on another SNAPSHOT component
** *Not reproducible* over time
** Reverts won't bring the previous working state
+
{nbsp}
+
* `alias mvn='mvn --no-snapshot-updates'` is your friend


== `srcdeps` wrap up

[options="step"]
* A tool for Maven and Gradle
* Allows declaring dependencies in terms of source commits/tags/branches instead of released versions
* Dependencies may not dictate your life anymore!
